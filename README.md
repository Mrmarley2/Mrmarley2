## A little bit about me

ðŸ”­I've been an analyst in the NHS for a long time - nearly 10 years.

ðŸŒ± I've got lots of experience writing R and T-SQL, fell in love with JavaScript and am getting there with it, and I have gradually come around to the idea that I should pick up some Python and C#.

âš¡What do I do well? Besides efficient and well-documented code, I have a love of presenting and talking publically. Online or in person, both work for me!
