## A little bit about me

ðŸ”­I was an information analyst in the NHS for a long time - nearly 10 years. Now I've left the public sector and moved into a more front-end world, combining data skills with front-end design.

ðŸŒ±I've got lots of experience writing R and T-SQL, fell in love with JavaScript and am getting there with it, and finally bit the Python bullet and have picked it up (definitely should have about 8 years ago!)

âš¡What do I do well? Besides efficient and well-documented code, I know how to combine it with effective user experiences to make something that people will remember. I also have a love of presenting and talking publically, probably from years as a trainer and mentor.
